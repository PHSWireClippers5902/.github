# Github Config Page

This is used to display a custom `README.md` on our GitHub home page. It doesn't contribute to our website, our website, or anything else like that. Instead, it's used to help keep our appearances up on GitHub. 

## ðŸ”„ Updating

Feel free to make updates to the `/profile/README.md` page as you see fit. This information is public and it helps describe who we are. 

Ideally, all social media accounts should be included - if we make a new one, we put it on the README.

## How to Help

Please don't edit this `README.md`. Instead, update our [/profile/README.md](https://github.com/PHSWireClippers5902/.github/tree/main/profile) with new content.

Thanks for your help!
