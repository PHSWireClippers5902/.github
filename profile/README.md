## We're the Wire Clippers. ðŸ‘‹ 

- We're the robotics team of Portsmouth High School
- We work to provide a practical education in engineering and leadership
- We compete in the First Robotics Competition
- We have [a very cool website](https://wireclippers.org) that we update regularly with new stuff.
- We're entirely funded by students and donations from [our sponsors](https://wireclippers.org/sponsor-us/)
- We've also got a documentation website that we use to publish docs that we (internally) use, and [stuff that anyone can benefit from.](https://phswireclippers5902.github.io/website-guidelines/)

We use GitHub to store our code for the robots, store code for embeds and other things on our website, and lots of other things.
